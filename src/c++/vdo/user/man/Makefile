# Explanation of the sed commands below that process vdostats.cat:
#
# Strip out anything before the line about how stats are reported in YAML.
#
# Strip out anything that doesn't have the right indentation level or
# doesn't start with bold text (x^Hx or ESC [ 1 m) that starts with a
# letter (i.e., not "--foo"). This gets rid of the descriptive
# paragraphs mixed in with the output field descriptions.
#
# Remove formatting, then remove leading indentation.
#
# (Currently nothing at the top level of the field descriptions has a
# short enough name for the field label and field description to be on
# the same line, so we don't need to worry about that case.)
#
# Filter out the man page references ("vdo(8)" in the SEE ALSO
# section).
