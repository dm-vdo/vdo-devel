 * @string: The start of the string. The string must be null-terminated.
 *          The first character may also be a plus sign, but not a minus sign.
 * @base: The number base to use. The maximum supported base is 16. If base is
 *        given as 0, then the base of the string is automatically detected
 *        with the conventional semantics - If it begins with 0x the number
 *        will be parsed as a hexadecimal (case insensitive), if it otherwise
 *        begins with 0, it will be parsed as an octal number. Otherwise it
 *        will be parsed as a decimal.
 * @result: Where to write the result of the conversion on success.
 *
 * The sole reason for the existence of this function is to allow writing
 * product source such that checkpatch doesn't complain about not using
 * kstrtouint for single format character reads of unsigned ints.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, -ERANGE on overflow and -EINVAL on parsing error.
 * Return code must be checked.
